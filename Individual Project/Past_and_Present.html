                     <h2> The Economic Impact of Fast Fashion</h2>
                      <!-- This information comes from https://maloney.house.gov/sites/maloney.house.gov/files/documents/The%20Economic%20Impact%20of%20the%20Fashion%20Industry%20--%20JEC%20report%20FINAL.pdf-->
<p>
        As the U.S. economy continues to grow and evolve, one of the many bright spots of our new
        creative economy is the fashion industry. With a growing number of high-value jobs that pay high
        wages, fashion is now having a big impact not only in fashion centers on the coasts, but also in
        smaller cities around the country.
       
        Fashion is a $1.2 trillion global industry, with more than $250 billion spent annually on fashion in
        the United States, according to industry analysts.
        1 Fashion and apparel industries employ 1.9
        million people in the United States and have a positive impact on regional economies across the
        country.2 New York City and Los Angeles are the two largest fashion hubs in the United States,
        with over two-thirds of all fashion designers employed in these cities.3 But they are not the whole
        story, and cities such as San Francisco, Nashville, and Columbus are beginning to reap economic
        benefits, including high-paying jobs in fashion design.
     
       
        Fashion is a structurally diverse industry, ranging from major international retailers to wholesalers
        to large design houses to one-person design shops. It employs people across occupations—including
        fashion designers, computer programmers, lawyers, accountants, copywriters, social media
        directors, and project managers. According to a report by the California Fashion Association,
        manufacturing is only a fraction of the modern apparel industry as “it is a highly sophisticated
        industry involving fashion and market research, brand licensing/intellectual property rights, design,
        materials engineering, product manufacturing, marketing and finally, distribution.”
        U.S. Apparel Manufacturing Produces High-Fashion, High-Value Products
        The fashion industry in America has changed dramatically over the past century. In 1931, the
        Garment District in New York was home to the highest concentration of apparel manufacturers in
        the world.6 Many of these jobs have since moved offshore. Over the past two decades, U.S.
        employment in the apparel manufacturing industry has declined sharply, from almost 940,000 in
        1990 to about 144,000 in 2013.7
       
        However, while many apparel manufacturing jobs have left the United States, new high-value
        fashion industry jobs are being created in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and other U.S.
        cities. As with many industries in the manufacturing sector, the United States now concentrates on
        the high-value parts of the apparel global supply chain: research and development (R&D), design
        and marketing.8 Jobs in these fields require more education and training—and they also hold the
        prospects of higher wages.9

        The U.S. apparel manufacturing industry currently runs a trade deficit. In 2014, U.S. apparel
        exports totaled roughly $6 billion, while imports were about $82 billion.10 Over one-third of U.S.
        apparel imports come from China (36 percent), with Vietnam (11 percent), Bangladesh (6 percent),
        Indonesia (6 percent), and Mexico (5 percent) rounding out the top five.11 While many apparel
        products are manufactured overseas, much of the value that goes into them is generated in the
        United States. Various studies note that conventional trade statistics may overstate the size of our
        trade deficit because they fail to fully capture the value added at different stages of the design and
        development process.

        Other consumer products, such as smart phones, electronics and toys, operate with similar business
        models. Profits in these industries derive more from establishing a strong brand name, researching
        market needs, and finding a niche than from scaling up production of a product and pushing it out to
        retailers.13 Recent studies focusing on Apple’s iPod—an example of a product designed and
        distributed in this country but largely manufactured overseas—have found that many of the highestvalue, highest-wage activities take place right here in the United States.14
        While much apparel manufacturing now takes place overseas, what remains in the United States is
        focused on high-fashion, high-value, quick-turnaround, high-margin orders. Computer-aided design
        helps designers turn concepts into samples, and helps manufacturers move from prototype to
        finished product on an accelerated timetable.
        
        Cities like New York and Los Angeles retain manufacturing bases that support the fashion industry.
        Apparel manufacturing represents three-in-10 manufacturing jobs in New York City.15 Nearly twoin-10 manufacturing firms in Los Angeles are in the apparel business.16

                     <h2>The Environmental Impact of Fast Fashion</h2>
                       <!-- This information comes from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6307129/-->
<p>
        Environmental justice is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, as the “fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, 
        color national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies” [5]. In the United States,
         this concept has primarily been used in the scientific literature and in practice to describe the disproportionate placement of superfund sites (hazardous waste sites) in or near 
         communities of color. However, environmental justice, as it has been defined, is not limited to the United States and need not be constrained by geopolitical boundaries. The textile and garment 
         industries, for example, shift the environmental and occupational burdens associated with mass production and disposal from high income countries to the under-resourced (e.g. low income, low-wage workers,
          women) communities in LMICs. Extending the environmental justice framework to encompass the disproportionate impact experienced by those who produce and dispose of our clothing is essential to understanding
         the magnitude of global injustice perpetuated through the consumption of cheap clothing. In the context of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 which calls for sustainable consumption and production as part of 
         national and sectoral plans, sustainable business practices, consumer behavior, and the reduction and elimination of fast fashion should all be a target of global environmental justice advocates.

         <h3> Environmental Hazards During Production</h3>

         <p>

                The first step in the global textile supply chain is textile production, the process by which both natural and synthetic fibers are made. Approximately 90 % of clothing sold in the United States is made 
                with cotton or polyester, both associated with significant health impacts from the manufacturing and production processes [6]. Polyester, a synthetic textile, is derived from oil, while cotton requires large 
                amounts of water and pesticides to grow. Textile dyeing results in additional hazards as untreated wastewater from dyes are often discharged into local water systems, releasing heavy metals and other toxicants 
                that can adversely impact the health of animals in addition to nearby residents.

         <h3> Textile Waste </h3>
          
         <p>
                While getting finished garments to consumers in the high-income countries is seen as the end of the line for the fashion industry, environmental injustices continue long after the garment is sold. The fast fashion 
                model encourages consumers to view clothing as disposable. In fact, the average American throws away approximately 80 pounds of clothing and textiles annually, occupying nearly 5% of landfill space. Clothing not
                 sent directly to the landfill often ends up in the second-hand clothing trade. Approximately 500,000 tons of used clothing are exported abroad from the United States each year, the majority ending up in LMICs.
                  In 2015, the United States exported more than $700 million worth of used clothing [13]. Second-hand clothing not sold in the United States market is compressed into 1000-pound bales and exported overseas to be 
                  “graded” (sorted, categorized and re-baled) by low-wage workers in LMICs and sold in second-hand markets. Clothing not sold in markets becomes solid waste, clogging rivers, greenways, and parks, and creating the 
                  potential for additional environmental health hazards in LMICs lacking robust municipal waste systems.
