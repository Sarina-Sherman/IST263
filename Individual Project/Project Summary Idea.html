    <h1> Project Idea Statement </h1>
    <p>     For my project, I want to create a website centered around sustainable fashion and what fast fashion truly is. <d1> <dt> Fast fashion: </dt> <dd> a cheaper and quicker runway-to-store turnover time as it is trend based.</dd></d1>
        There are currently a lot of people who are joining the anti-fast fashion movement, but not many people realize they still shop at fast fashion retailers.
        I plan to break up the website into five sections: what is sustainable fashion, the history of fast-fashion, who are fast-fashion retailers, the appeal of it, and what we can do in the future.
        Typically, fast-fashion is <abbr>B2B</abbr> where a factory sells to a business and then <abbr>B2C</abbr> where the business then sells to consumers.

            Interestingly, there are many documents from the UK government on fast-fashion, sustainability, and breaking down this cycle. 
        Since the UK is known for street-ware, I believe using these government documents could be extremely fascinating. 
        In terms of images, I can use some images from company websites since some have a section on their sustainability efforts on the About Us page.
