<h3> About Me!</h3 >

<P> Growing up in the big city of Chicago with Michigan Avenue being the hub of fashion, I spent my days walking downtown looking at street style and reading magazines like 'picture books' as my mom called it,
    flipping through for the newest and best fashion. Since the start, I have been fascinated by brands' values and their strategic planning, so, of course, I am a public relations and retail management dual!
    Every brand has a choice in how they will change the environment, society, and world, and this is evidence of how this seemingly small choice makes all the difference. We all think we know what fast fashion is and how to avoid it,
    but do we really know what and who fast fashion is?  </P>

    <h2> First of all, what is 'Fast Fashion'?
    </h2>
    <!-- This information comes from https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmenvaud/1952/1952.pdf -->
<p>
    ‘Fast fashion’ is a term used to describe a new accelerated fashion business model that
    has evolved since the 1980s. It involves increased numbers of new fashion collections
    every year, quick turnarounds and often lower prices. Reacting rapidly to offer new
    products to meet consumer demand is crucial to this business model. Often times, this model is criticised for driving
    overconsumption, the production of clothes so cheap they are being treated disposably,
    and excessive waste. </p>

    <h2> Okay...but what does this mean?</h2>
 <!-- This information comes from https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0433-7-->
    <p>Globally, 80 billion pieces of new clothing are purchased each year, translating to $1.2 trillion annually for the global fashion industry. 
    The majority of these products are assembled in China and Bangladesh while the United States consumes more clothing and textiles than any other nation in the world [1]. 
    Approximately 85 % of the clothing Americans consume, nearly 3.8 billion pounds annually, is sent to landfills as solid waste, amounting to nearly 80 pounds per American per year [2, 3].

    The global health costs associated with the production of cheap clothing are substantial. While industrial disasters such as the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire have led to 
    improved occupational protections and work standards in the United States, the same cannot be said for LMICs. The hazardous working conditions that attracted regulatory attention in the United States and European Union have 
    not been eliminated, but merely shifted overseas. The social costs associated with the global textile and garment industry are significant as well. Defined as “all direct and indirect losses sustained by third
    persons or the general public as a result of unrestrained economic activities,” the social costs involved in the production of fast fashion include damages to the environment, human health, and human rights at each step along the production chain</p>
